<b>Definitions</b> <br> <br>

<b>Safety</b> <br> <br>
•	An acceptable level of risk <br>
•	Freedom from hazards <br>
•	Science/activity directed at controlling hazards & preventing accidents <br>
<b>Hazard</b> <br>
•	Condition or situation that can cause/contribute to an accident <br>
•	Common hazards include: fall to a lower level, struck-by, caught in, under, or between, contact with, etc <br><br>
<b>Accident</b> <br>
•	Unplanned release of energy that results in injury or property damage <br>
•	Usually when force of energy released exceeds threshold limit value of affected body or object <br> <br>
<b>Risk</b> <br>
•	Measure of both probability & severity of all hazards associated with a given activity or condition <br><br>
<b>Incident</b> <br>
•	Unplanned event that may or may not cause loss <br>
•	All accidents are incidents, but not all incidents are accidents <br>
•	Incidents that do not result in loss indicate a breakdown in the safety system, & investigated <br> <br>
<b>Safety Management</b> <br>
•	Planning, organizing, directing, monitoring/controlling those activities necessary to achieve an organization’s loss prevention & loss control objectives <br> <br>
<b>Loss Control</b> <br>
•	Program whose purpose is to minimize accident-based financial losses <br>
•	Analysis of property damage is considered to be a highly desirable, worthwhile activity <br>
Loss Prevention <br>
•	Describes a before-the-loss (proactive) program designed to identify & correct potential accident problems <br> <br>

<b>Causes Of Accidents </b> <br>
•	Accident cause complex <br>
•	Failure of people, equipment, materials, or environment to behave or react as expected <br>
•	Man <br>
•	Machines <br>
•	Materials <br>
•	Environment <br> <br>

<b>Lack of Control</b> <br>
Management’s commitment to safety must be transparent through its actions. <br>
Management policies/decisions & failure to ensure compliance for: <br>
•	leadership & administration <br>
•	management training <br>
•	planned inspections <br>
•	task analysis & procedures <br>

•	Employee training <br>
•	General promotion <br>
•	Personal communication <br>
•	Group meetings <br>
•	Health control <br>
•	Off-the-job safety <br> <br>

<b>Accident Prevention Program Strategy </b> <br>
•	Injuries can be prevented when management fully supports the prevention program & everyone lives up to their responsibilities <br>
•	ACCOUNTABILITY <br> <br>

<b>Total Safety Work Culture</b> <br>
Strong management commitment to safety is essential, as safety is a value, not a priority. <br>
Priorities get rearranged in reaction to schedules, resources, orders, etc. Values endure & represent a foundation we base our decisions & actions. Safety is more than compliance. <br>
Balanced attention given equally to environment, behavior & person. Program must be positive, i.e., focusing on implementing safe practices, not avoidance of mistakes or unsafe acts. It is essential that supervisors consistently promote safe performance by words & actions. Authority is a powerful force in determining the behavior of others.
We should be our brother’s keeper. Assuming that no accidents or good incidence rate (IR) means a safe operation is misleading. At-risk behavior may have reached or may be reaching critical levels. <br> <br>
<b>Role of Management</b> <br>
•	Establish standards/policies <br>
•	Hiring & selection <br>
•	New employee training <br>
•	Skills/task training <br>
•	Adequate job instruction <br>
•	PPE <br>
•	Job analysis procedures <br>
•	Supervisory training <br>
•	Annual refresher safety training <br>
•	Engineering controls <br>
•	Purchasing controls<br>
•	Planned inspections  <br>
•	Maintenance <br>
•	Accident investigations <br>
•	Group communications <br>
•	Emergency/evacuation plan <br>
•	First aid care <br>
•	Safety coaching program <br>
•	Performance reinforcing procedures<br>
Implement policies & enforce procedures, with continuous monitoring & control.<br>
•	Plan <br>
•	Do <br>
•	Check <br>
•	Act<br>
