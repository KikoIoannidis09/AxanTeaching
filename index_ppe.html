   <b> Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</b> <br>
PPE includes all clothing and work accessories designed to protect employees from workplace hazards. Protective equipment should not replace engineering, administrative, or procedural controls for safety; it should be used in conjunction with these controls. <br> <br>
<b>PPE includes the following: </b> <br>
•   Eye Protection <br>
•   Face Shields <br>
•   Head Protection <br>
•   Hand and Extremity Protective Equipment <br>
•   Protective Clothing <br>
•   Respiratory Devices <br>
•   Noise and Hearing Protectors <br>
•   Protective Shields and Barriers <br> <br>
<b>PPE must be: </b> <br>
•   Maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition <br>
•   Available to trained users when needed <br>
•   Used wherever necessary to protect an employee from hazards encountered in the workplace <br> <br>
<b>PPE protects against process or environmental hazards from:</b> <br>
•   Chemicals <br>
•   Radiation and Extreme Temperatures <br>
•   Mechanical irritants and other physical substances <br> <br>
<b>Hazards cause injury or harm through: </b> <br>
•   Absorption <br>
•   Inhalation <br>
•   Physical Contact <br> <br>
Employers must protect employees from hazards such as falling objects, harmful substances, and noise exposures that can cause injury. Employers must: <br>
•   Use all feasible engineering and work practice controls to eliminate and reduce hazards. <br>
•   Use personal protective equipment (PPE) if the controls don’t eliminate the hazards.<br>
•   PPE is the last level of control! <br> <br>
When PPE is required to protect employees, it must be provided by the employer at no cost to employees, except for specific items, such as: <br>
•   Safety-toe footwear, <br>
•   Prescription safety eyewear <br>
•   Everyday clothing and weather-related gear <br>

                <p class="p1">
         If the work environment can be physically changed to prevent employee exposure to the potential hazard, then the hazard can be eliminated with an engineering control. <br>
<b>Examples :</b> <br>
•   Initial design specifications <br>
•   Substitute less harmful material <br>
•   Change process <br>
•   Enclose process <br>
•   Isolate process <br>
If employees can change the way they do their jobs and the exposure to the potential hazard is removed, then the hazard can be eliminated with a work practice control. <br> <br>

<b>Responsibilities</b> <br>

<b>Employer</b> <br> 
•   Assess workplace for hazards  <br>
•   Provide PPE <br>
•   Determine when to use <br>
•   Provide PPE training for employees and instruction in proper use <br> <br>
<b>Employee </b> <br>
•   Use PPE in accordance with training received and other instructions <br>
•   Inspect daily and maintain in a clean and reliable condition <br> <br>

    <b>PPE Program </b> <br>
Includes procedures for selecting, providing and using PPE. <br>
First - assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the use of PPE. After selecting PPE, provide training to employees who are required to use it. <br> <br>

<b>Training</b> <br> 

<b>If PPE use is required, employees must be trained for:</b> <br>
•   Why it is necessary <br>
•   How it will protect them <br>
•   What are its limitations <br>
•   When and how to wear <br>
•   How to identify signs of wear <br>
•   How to clean and disinfect <br>
•   What is its useful life & how it should be disposed <br> <br>
<b>Retraining Occurs when: </b> <br>
•   The employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the understanding and skill required <br>
•   Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete <br>
•   Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete <br>
Inadequacies in an employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the required understanding or skill to properly use the protective equipment and that employee must be retrained before being allowed to perform any work that requires the use of PPE. <br>
The employer shall verify that each affected employee has received and understood the required training through a written certification that contains the name of each employee trained, the date of training, and that identifies the subject of the certification. <br> <br>

<b>Head protection</b> is required when there is a potential for injury to the head. Hard hats and similar headgear are specifically designed to reduce the impact of a falling object, overhead, protruding or bump hazards. The hard outer shell prevents the object from direct contact with the skull, the space between the outer and inner shell absorbs the shock of the falling object, and the soft inner shell spreads the impact over a greater area, reducing the potential for injury even more. Specialized protective headgear is required when there is exposure to electrical conductors which could contact the head. Electrical protective helmets are specifically designed to reduce electrical shock hazards. <br> <br>

<b>Classes of Hard Hats </b> <br>
<i>Class G1 </i> <br>
•   General service (e.g., mining, building construction, shipbuilding, lumbering, and manufacturing). Good impact protection but limited voltage protection. <br>
<i>Class E1 </i> <br>
•   Electrical work. Protect against falling objects, high-voltage shock/burns <br> 
<i>Class C </i> <br> 
•   Designed for comfort, offer limited protection. Protects heads that may bump against fixed objects, but do not protect against falling objects or electrical shock. <br> <br>

    <b>Electrical Protective Devices</b> <br>
Insulating blankets, matting, covers, line hose, gloves, and sleeves made of rubber must be marked with the manufacturer’s name, and the type or class of the product. They must meet specific compliance standards for insulating properties and have no irregularities in the workmanship. <br> 
Electrical protective equipment must also be maintained in good and reliable condition, and have no breaks, cracks or other deformities that would impact the insulating and protective properties of the device. <br>
Insulating gloves may be combined with other types of gloves to provide additional protection from extreme cold or other hazards, however the electrical insulating glove portion must be worn closest to the skin. <br>

     <b>Respiratory</b> <br>
Engineering controls should be put into place before any respirator is used. The primary objective is to prevent contamination before respirators are required. Respirator use should be required only when engineering controls fail to eliminate or lessen the hazard to acceptable limits. When any type of respirator is used, the employer is required to provide: <br>
•   A workplace hazard evaluation <br>
•   Proper selection of the types of respiratory equipment, based on the hazards in the workplace <br>
•   A written program and specific written procedures  Medical evaluations and surveillance <br>
•   Annual Training and Fit-testing <br>
•   A variety of types and sizes of respiratory equipment to accommodate different sizes and to fit the facial features of the employee <br>
•   Means to clean, care for and dispose of equipment and components <br>

     The use of a full faced respirator may be used in the food industry when dealing with operations that involve a hazardous environment. For example, where Ammonia is used in food preservation an organic vapor cartridge would work in conjunction with the full-face respirator. <br> <br>
<b>Noise</b> <br>
Hearing Protection is required when noise levels exceed the regulatory limits established by OSHA. The general rule of thumb is that if an area is too noisy to carry on a conversation without yelling at one another, then you need to test for noise levels. Noise level testing requires a calibrated noise level meter. When required a written hearing conservation program must be developed and implemented which includes monitoring and sampling, engineering controls, yearly medical hearing examinations (audiograms), written procedures, use of hearing protection, training, communication with employees and recordkeeping. <br>
